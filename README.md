# Overview

This repo houses the custom backend logic for [racquetrivals.com](https://www.racquetrivals.com). The app uses Pocketbase, a BaaS that provides a SQLite database and built-in APIs to interact with it.

Pocketbase offers a way to extend its functionality by importing it into a new Go package, and adding custom logic to that new package ([documentation](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-overview/)).
